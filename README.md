## What did you learn while making this app?
I learned how to use JavaScript to process user inputs, perform unit conversions, and dynamically update the DOM.

## What feature did you enjoy building the most?
I enjoyed creating the size comparison table that displays results instantly after clicking convert.

## What would you add next if you had more time?
I would add more clothing brands, responsive design improvements, and a save/share feature for the results.
